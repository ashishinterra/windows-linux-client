KeyTalk automated Apache certificate renewal remote deployment instructions
===========================================================================

Introduction
------------
KeyTalk provides automatic Apache certificate renewal functionality. To update
and reconfigure a server farm with many servers however is tedious work.
To automate deployments to many servers, the remote deployment tool allows you to:
* Configure all virtual hosts of your server farm in one place
* Install KeyTalk Apache certificate updater to each remote machine of your server farm, which includes:
    - Customizing your KeyTalk client with an RCCD file
    - Customizing your certificate renewal script configuration (`apache.ini`)
    - Enabling periodic certificate renewal (by default checking every 10 minutes)
* Remotely uninstall the KeyTalk client from a server

The following sections explain how to:
* Prepare web servers
* Configure Virtual Hosts
* Deploy Remotely
* Uninstall Remotely

Prepare web servers
-------------------------------------------
First of all, make sure that all the servers you want to deploy to have the
following software installed:

- RHEL 6/7 x64 or CentOS 6/7 x64
- Debian 8/9 x64 or Ubuntu 16.04/18.04/19.04 LTS x64
- Python 2.7.x
- Apache 2.2 - 2.4 with SSL module enabled

This deployment script requires password-less SSH access to the machines
you want to deploy to.

Setting up password-less SSH logins requires the following steps:

1. Generate an SSH key pair (one-time, only if you don't have one yet)
2. Copy your identity (public key) to all remote servers
3. Cache your key passphrase using ssh agent (only if you have a passphrase)


For example:

    $ ssh-keygen  # only if there is no ssh key pair yet

    $ ssh-copy-id root@10.0.0.1
    root@10.0.0.1's password: ****
    Number of key(s) added: 1

    $ ssh-copy-id root@10.0.0.2
    root@10.0.0.1's password: ****
    Number of key(s) added: 1

    ...

    $ ssh-add
    Enter passphrase for /home/me/.ssh/id_rsa: ****
    Identity added: /home/me/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/me/.ssh/id_rsa)

You can check that you can log in without a password:

    $ ssh root@10.0.0.1
    (no password should be asked)

Configure Virtual Hosts
------------------------------
The configuration format of the deployment script is the same as the
configuration described in the
[KeyTalk automated Apache certificate renewal installation instructions](KeyTalk_LinuxClient_for_Apache.txt) with
addition of the `RemoteHost` property to each virtual host.

The `RemoteHost` should contain `<user>@<host>` (e.g. `root@10.0.0.1`). The
value should be a user/host combination to which password-less ssh logins are
enabled.

For instance, the following configuration shows three virtual hosts, distributed
over two servers (`a.example.com` and `b.example.com` on `root@10.0.0.1` and `c.example.com` on `root@10.0.0.2`):

```json
[
  {
    "RemoteHost" : "root@10.0.0.1",
    "VHost" : "*:443",
    "ServerName" : "a.example.com",
    "KeyTalkProvider" : "MyProvider",
    "KeyTalkService" : "MY_SERVICE",
    "KeyTalkUser" : "a.example.com"
  },
  {
    "RemoteHost" : "root@10.0.0.1",
    "VHost" : "*:443",
    "ServerName" : "b.example.com",
    "KeyTalkProvider" : "MyProvider",
    "KeyTalkService" : "MY_SERVICE",
    "KeyTalkUser" : "b.example.com"
  },
  {
    "RemoteHost" : "root@10.0.0.2",
    "VHost" : "*:443",
    "ServerName" : "c.example.com",
    "KeyTalkProvider" : "MyProvider",
    "KeyTalkService" : "MY_SERVICE",
    "KeyTalkUser" : "c.example.com"
  }
]
```

The above examples show three simple cases without password and e-mail
notifications. A fully customized example for VHost configuration looks as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "RemoteHost" : "root@10.0.0.1",
    "VHost" : "*:443",
    "ServerName" : "d.example.com",
    "KeyTalkProvider" : "MyProvider",
    "KeyTalkService" : "MY_SERVICE",
    "KeyTalkUser" : "c.example.com",
    "EmailNotifications" : true,
    "EmailFrom" : "me@example.com",
    "EmailTo" : "you@example.com",
    "EmailServer" : "smtp.example.com",
    "EmailSubject" : "Apache Certificate Renewal"
  }
]
```

Deploy Remotely
----------------------------
After preparing your servers for password-less SSH login and configuring your
VHosts you can use the following command to start deployment:

    $ ./ktclient_remote_deploy install <PATH_TO_apache.ini>
          <KeyTalk installer.tgz> <service_configuration.rccd> | tee <logfile>

For example:

    $ ./ktclient_remote_deploy install apache.ini
          KeyTalkClient-5.Y.Z.linux.tgz my_services.rccd | tee log.txt

**Note:Name of configuration file should be apache.ini.**

If deployment on one of the hosts fails, the deployment script will attempt
to uninstall the failed installation and continue with the next host.

Uninstall Remotely
----------------------------
To uninstall an installed KeyTalk linux client remotely you also need to have
password-less SSH access to the system.

To uninstall remotely, you can use the following command:

    $ ./ktclient_remote_deploy remove <user>@<host>

For example:

    $ ./ktclient_remote_deploy remove root@10.0.0.1
