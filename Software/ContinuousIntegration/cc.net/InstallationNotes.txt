1. Use KeyTalk Windows client Development VM as a base system for the build server (make sure new VM UUID is created)

2. Install CruiseControl.net

3. Choose a build version, currently either WindowsClient or Windows10SmartCardClient and replace it with [version] below

4. Make sure paths in ContinuousIntegration\cc.net\[version]\ccnet.config and ContinuousIntegration\cc.net\[version]\ccservice.exe.config are correct, create directories for build logs and build state is necessary

5. Copy/merge ContinuousIntegration\cc.net\[version]\ccservice.exe.config to the one installed by CruiseControl.NET (typically in C:\Program Files\CruiseControl.NET\server), backing up the original one first.

6. Copy build output stylesheet(s) from ContinuousIntegration\cc.net\xsl\ directory to C:\Program Files\CruiseControl.NET\server\xsl\

7. Upload build server ssh private key id_rsa to %USERPROFILE%/.ssh/ on the build server
	- In case this folder does not exist, copy it from an existing machine
    - This key allows read-only access to KeyTalk git repository
    - make sure repository URL with key authentication is used: ssh://git@stash.keytalk.com:7999/keytalk/core.git

8. Configure CruiseControl.net service to start automatically under current user account instead of default LocalSystem.
   -  LocalSystem account would not allow using ssh key and installing client ini files to the user profile
	- see %tmp%\ccnet.log for troubleshooting

9. Create minimal KeyTalk client installation:
  - Change path in ContinuousIntegration\cc.net\resept.ini if needed
  - Import CertKeys\CommunicationAndSigning\pcacert.der to the "Trusted Root" Windows certificate store
  - Import CertKeys\CommunicationAndSigning\signingcacert.der and CertKeys\CommunicationAndSigning\commcacert.der to the "Intermediate" Windows certificate store.

10. [optionally] Download, install and configure CcTray tool (from http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccnet/files/CruiseControl.NET%20Releases/CruiseControl.NET%201.8.5/ or later version)
   - make sure to allow firewall to allow monitoring of CC.NET server from the outside
   
11. In CcTray go to Settings -> Build Projects. Add server using 'Connect directly using .NET remoting' to the desired host (likely localhost)

12. Make a test build run, e.g. by kicking it from CcTray.
  - check log directory (e.g. D:\builds\logs\) and %tmp%\ccnet.log for troubleshooting
  - update md5 of %windir%\winhlp32.exe on the server (CUST_PASSWD_INTERNAL_FILE service) if necessary

13. Set system time to UTC & reset the CruiseControl service

14. Share KeyTalk source folder (read-only) as "builds" so developers can access it from their machines

15. Enable Remote Desktop connections to this machine

16. Convert VMX VM to OVF and import it to Vmware ESX server
